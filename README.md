# Snow Bullying Bot

The purpose of this project is to have a bit of fun with Snow (but it's been expanded to add more people) by implementing various Discord bot commands and interactions. This is a creative collection of ideas, all bundled into a single file. It's my first time making a source like this, so it might be a bit messy with everything all over the place.
